  "A richly illustrated book full of never-before published typewriter memorabilia, intriguing historical documents and entertaining anecdotes, The Typewriter: a Graphic History of the Beloved Machine is a beautiful ode to an all-but-obsolete creative companion.<br>
The Typewriter book is 336 pages and a handsome size of 9 x 11 inches and it weighs in at nearly 4 pounds. There's a special uncoated section for a selection of ads from the 1880s-1890s plus an extra mini booklet insert on "How to be a Super Secretary" from the 1950s. <br>Filled with images and advertising spanning over a century, the graphic story of The Typewriter is presented in a unique way. Through the vintage ephemera, readers will discover the history of not only the machine, but the progression of society through very interesting times. From the industrial revolution to women entering the workforce, from one World War to another, from the home to the office, from collegiate life to Hollywood and pop culture..."<br>

    The typewriter helped revolutionise the world of work and change the lives of working women in particular. It helped them launch their own businesses at a time when female employers were rare and became a vital weapon in the fight for women’s suffrage. Typewriters inspired novelists and artists, with American writer Mark Twain among the first to use what he called a “new-fangled writing machine”.
    
    Despite being erased from many offices by the rise of computers, the typewriter has remained a beloved design icon which is still in use todayA typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for typing characters. Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and each one causes a different single character to be produced on paper by striking an inked ribbon selectively against the paper with a type element. At the end of the nineteenth century, the term 'typewriter' was also applied to a person who used such a device.In 1829, an American by the name of William Austin Burt patented a machine that he called a “Typographer”, this was considered to be one of the first typewriters to have existed.

    <p>Typewriter technology advanced to include electric models, before the rise in computers saw them gradually phased out of offices. However, the unique experience of writing on a typewriter and the enduring beauty of their design mean there is still a demand for the machines.

      Whatever you use – a pen, computer or typewriter – has an effect on how you write and the style you develop. And it isn’t just the process of typing that attracts users to the machines. 19th century American novelist Henry James found the noise of a Remington typewriter inspiring. For some, the typewriter focused their thinking.</p>
